# SQL Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing structured relational data using SQL to answer business-driven questions.  
The goal was to explore, clean, and query data efficiently while extracting meaningful insights using SQL alone.

This project emphasizes **query accuracy, logical thinking, and analytical depth**, not database administration or ETL pipelines.

## Objectives
- Explore relational datasets using SQL
- Clean and validate raw data
- Write efficient aggregation and filtering queries
- Answer real-world business questions
- Apply SQL analytical functions where appropriate

---

## Tools & Environment
- SQL
- Relational Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server equivalent)
- SQL Client (e.g., SSMS, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench)

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of structured tables containing business-related records such as:
- Transactions
- Customers
- Products
- Time-based records

The schema supports joins across multiple tables to enable meaningful analysis.
